# symbolic-systems-architecture
 A formal taxonomy and cartographic framework for representational systems.



Symbolic Systems Architecture (SSA)

Symbolic Systems Architecture (SSA) is a cartographic meta-discipline for analyzing, classifying, and diagnosing Representational Systems — the symbolic structures that shape perception, coordination, identity, and action.

SSA does not propose beliefs, doctrines, or solutions.
It provides maps.

In an environment saturated with narratives, frameworks, ideologies, prompts, and models, orientation becomes the scarce resource. SSA addresses that scarcity by making representational structure explicit.

What SSA Studies

SSA studies Representational Systems (RS) — structured mappings that:
	•	compress complexity,
	•	stand in for reality,
	•	propagate across minds,
	•	and exert downward influence on cognition and behavior.

Examples include:
	•	language
	•	mathematics
	•	religion
	•	law
	•	therapy models
	•	art systems
	•	scientific paradigms
	•	ideologies
	•	rituals
	•	AI prompts
	•	institutional frameworks

SSA is concerned not with what these systems claim, but with how they operate, where power accumulates, and how exit costs emerge.

⸻

What SSA Is Not

SSA is not:
	•	a philosophy
	•	a belief system
	•	a spiritual framework
	•	a therapeutic model
	•	a political ideology
	•	a metaphysical theory

SSA does not tell you what to think.
It clarifies what kind of system you are inside.

Design Commitments

SSA prioritizes:
	•	structural clarity over persuasion
	•	explicit axes over blended concepts
	•	exit-cost awareness over conversion
	•	diagnostic utility over narrative appeal
	•	composability over totalization

SSA treats reification as a failure mode, not an achievement.

Status

This repository currently contains:
	•	the canonical taxonomy of Representational Systems
	•	the core axes used for classification and diagnosis

Future artifacts (if added) will be explicitly marked as downstream, applied, or experimental.

Closing Note

Most systems compete for belief.
Some compete for adoption.
SSA competes only for clarity.

Maps are quiet.
They matter anyway.
