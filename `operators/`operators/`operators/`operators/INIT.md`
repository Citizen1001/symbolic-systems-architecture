# INIT Operator

STATUS: Experimental (Contained)
LAYER: Meta / Generative
OPERATING MODE: Recursive
COHERENCE DEPENDENCY: Self-modifying (unstable)

FUNCTION:
Instantiate symbolic systems capable of mutating their own axioms, primitives, and grammar.

INPUT TYPE:
Axioms, primitives, constraints

OUTPUT TYPE:
Evolving symbolic frameworks + representations

PRIMARY USE:
Exploration, pedagogy, sandboxed prototyping

RISKS / FAILURE MODES:
Runaway recursion; abstraction collapse; loss of grounding

ECOSYSTEM FIT:
Adjacent to SSA (Sandbox only)

NOTES:
INIT is not a tool — it's a petri dish.
It should inform SSA, not inhabit it.

Verdict:
Separate repo is correct. No fusion until hard constraints exist.
