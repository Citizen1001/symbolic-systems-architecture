# DNA Architect Operator

STATUS: Core
LAYER: Structural / Meta
OPERATING MODE: Stabilizing
COHERENCE DEPENDENCY: Spine-generating

FUNCTION:
Extract the irreducible survival core and constraint structure of a system.

INPUT TYPE:
Belief system, project, framework, argument, organization

OUTPUT TYPE:
Minimal core axioms + non-negotiables + failure vectors

PRIMARY USE:
System auditing, foundation-setting, pre-design validation

RISKS / FAILURE MODES:
False minimalism; mistaking efficiency for truth

ECOSYSTEM FIT:
SSA (Spine)

NOTES:
This is not a "move" in the casual sense — it is a precondition operator.
Every other serious move implicitly depends on it.

Verdict:
Promotion justified. Non-negotiable.
