`# Operators MoveRegistry`
# DNAArchitect Operator


STATUS: Core
LAYER: Structural / Meta
OPERATING MODE: Stabilizing
COHERENCE DEPENDENCY: Spine-generating

FUNCTION:
Extract the irreducible survival core and constraint structure of a system.

INPUT TYPE:
Belief system, project, framework, argument, organization

OUTPUT TYPE:
Minimal core axioms + non-negotiables + failure vectors

PRIMARY USE:
System auditing, foundation-setting, pre-design validation

RISKS / FAILURE MODES:
False minimalism; mistaking efficiency for truth

ECOSYSTEM FIT:
SSA (Spine)

NOTES:
This is not a “move” in the casual sense — it is a precondition operator.
Every other serious move implicitly depends on it.

Verdict:
Promotion justified. Non-negotiable.

⸻

MOVE NAME: Disassembler

STATUS: Quarantined (Intentional)
LAYER: Disruptive
OPERATING MODE: Destabilizing
COHERENCE DEPENDENCY: Spine-threatening

FUNCTION:
Deliberately fracture coherence to expose hidden assumptions and induce novelty.

INPUT TYPE:
Highly coherent concepts, identities, narratives, systems

OUTPUT TYPE:
Fragments, ambiguity fields, noise patterns

PRIMARY USE:
Creative resets, deconditioning, assumption sabotage

RISKS / FAILURE MODES:
Irrecoverable incoherence; nihilism; loss of evaluative signal

ECOSYSTEM FIT:
Standalone / Creative-only

NOTES:
This is not unsafe by accident.
It is unsafe by design.
Must never be invoked without a reassembly or audit operator downstream.

Verdict:
Correctly quarantined. Valuable because it is volatile.

⸻

MOVE NAME: INIT

STATUS: Experimental (Contained)
LAYER: Meta / Generative
OPERATING MODE: Recursive
COHERENCE DEPENDENCY: Self-modifying (unstable)

FUNCTION:
Instantiate symbolic systems capable of mutating their own axioms, primitives, and grammar.

INPUT TYPE:
Axioms, primitives, constraints

OUTPUT TYPE:
Evolving symbolic frameworks + representations

PRIMARY USE:
Exploration, pedagogy, sandboxed prototyping

RISKS / FAILURE MODES:
Runaway recursion; abstraction collapse; loss of grounding

ECOSYSTEM FIT:
Adjacent to SSA (Sandbox only)

NOTES:
INIT is not a tool — it’s a petri dish.
It should inform SSA, not inhabit it.

Verdict:
Separate repo is correct. No fusion until hard constraints exist.

⸻

MOVE NAME: SDM (Systemic Dissonance Management)

STATUS: Core
LAYER: Structural / Diagnostic
OPERATING MODE: Transformative
COHERENCE DEPENDENCY: Requires spine

FUNCTION:
Map how systems externalize, suppress, redistribute, or ritualize internal contradictions.

INPUT TYPE:
Ideologies, institutions, belief systems, narratives

OUTPUT TYPE:
Dissonance topology + management strategies

PRIMARY USE:
Critique, system health analysis, integrity audits

RISKS / FAILURE MODES:
Over-application leading to cynicism or reductionism

ECOSYSTEM FIT:
SSA (Analytical arm)

NOTES:
This is how SSA detects why systems lie to themselves without moralizing.

Verdict:
Correctly promoted. Flagship analytic move.
