0. What This Document Is (and Is Not)

This document establishes the canonical definition, axes, and functional classes of Representational Systems (RS) within the discipline of Symbolic Systems Architecture (SSA).

It is intentionally:
	•	non-persuasive
	•	non-exhaustive
	•	non-metaphysical
	•	non-prescriptive

It does not:
	•	assert ultimate truths about reality
	•	propose a belief system
	•	define a worldview
	•	instruct behavior or identity
	•	replace existing disciplines

SSA is a cartographic meta-discipline.
This document defines its map, not its destinations.

⸻

1. Definition: Representational System (RS)

A Representational System (RS) is:

A structured mapping that converts raw experience, observation, or complexity into stable symbols, rules, and operations that enable perception, prediction, coordination, identity formation, or action — and which feeds back into cognition and behavior.

Key Properties (Necessary Conditions)

A structure qualifies as an RS if and only if it:
	1.	Stands in for reality
(It represents; it does not equal what it represents)
	2.	Compresses complexity
(Reduces dimensionality, ambiguity, or uncertainty)
	3.	Is portable across minds
(Transmissible via learning, symbols, or imitation)
	4.	Feeds back into behavior or cognition
(Exerts downward influence once adopted)

If a structure does not alter perception, decision-making, or coordination, it is information, not a representational system.

⸻

2. Core Axes of Representational Systems

All representational systems can be located along five independent axes.

Most confusion, manipulation, and reification occurs when these axes are unconsciously conflated.

These axes are descriptive, not evaluative.

⸻

Axis 1: Representational Medium

What the system is made of
	1.	Linguistic
Language, narratives, doctrines, labels
(e.g. religion, ideology, therapy language)
	2.	Symbolic / Iconic
Images, sigils, diagrams, archetypes
(e.g. totems, flags, mandalas, tarot)
	3.	Numerical / Formal
Numbers, equations, metrics, scores
(e.g. economics, astrology-as-symbolic, statistics)
	4.	Procedural / Ritualized
Ordered sequences of action
(e.g. rituals, AA steps, workflows)
	5.	Spatial / Structural
Maps, hierarchies, architectures
(e.g. org charts, curricula, OS interfaces)

Note:
High-impact systems are almost always hybrids, not pure forms.

⸻

Axis 2: Scope of Application

What domain the system claims authority over
	1.	Personal
	2.	Interpersonal
	3.	Collective / Cultural
	4.	Technical / Operational
	5.	Cosmological / Totalizing

⚠️ Diagnostic warning:
Unacknowledged scope expansion (e.g. personal → cosmological) is a common marker of coercive drift.

⸻

Axis 3: Direction of Causation

How influence flows
	1.	Descriptive (Upward-facing)
Claims to reflect reality
(e.g. measurement, diagnostics, science)
	2.	Prescriptive (Downward-facing)
Claims to shape behavior or outcomes
(e.g. therapy models, policy, workflows)
	3.	Performative (Self-validating)
Becomes “true” through adoption
(e.g. money, roles, belief systems)

⚠️ Most power resides where performative systems masquerade as descriptive.

⸻

Axis 4: Closure & Exit Cost

How difficult it is to leave the system
	1.	Open
Provisional, revisable, low identity cost
	2.	Soft-Closed
Social or emotional exit penalties
	3.	Hard-Closed
Identity collapse, ostracism, fear penalties

This axis is ethical, not epistemic.

⸻

Axis 5: Agency Distribution

Where interpretive authority resides
	1.	User-Centered
Meaning generated by the individual
	2.	Guide-Centered
Authority vested in teachers, leaders, experts
	3.	System-Centered
Authority embedded in rules, algorithms, dogma

⚠️ Highest risk profile:
Guide-centered + Hard-closed + Performative

⸻

3. Functional Classes of Representational Systems

The following are functional categories, not value judgments.
Any RS may occupy multiple classes simultaneously.

⸻

1. Interpretive Frameworks

Purpose: Make sense of experience
Primary orientation: Descriptive

Examples:
	•	Jungian archetypes
	•	Enneagram
	•	Astrology (as symbolic language)

Failure mode:
	•	Reification (“I am this”)

⸻

2. Identity Scaffolds

Purpose: Stabilize self or group identity
Primary orientation: Performative

Examples:
	•	Diagnoses
	•	Personality typologies
	•	Religious identity

Failure mode:
	•	Identity foreclosure

⸻

3. Coordination Systems

Purpose: Align behavior at scale
Orientation: Prescriptive + Performative

Examples:
	•	Religion
	•	Nation-states
	•	Corporate culture

Failure mode:
	•	Suppression of dissent

⸻

4. Operational Systems

Purpose: Produce outcomes
Orientation: Procedural

Examples:
	•	Curricula
	•	Workflows
	•	Operating systems
	•	AI prompts

Failure mode:
	•	Dehumanization via over-execution

⸻

5. Meta-Representational Systems

Purpose: Analyze, compare, or design other RS

Examples:
	•	Semiotics
	•	Cybernetics
	•	Systems theory
	•	Symbolic Systems Architecture (SSA)

Failure mode:
	•	Paralysis through infinite reflection

⸻

4. Non-Claims (Critical Boundary Conditions)

SSA does not claim:
	•	Ontological primacy
	•	Epistemic finality
	•	Moral authority
	•	Therapeutic efficacy
	•	Political prescription
	•	Spiritual truth

SSA is structural, not salvational.

⸻

5. Versioning & Stability Rules

To prevent drift and reification:
	•	Core axes may only change via explicit version increments
	•	Functional classes are extensible; axes are not
	•	Downstream frameworks must reference this document explicitly
	•	SSA prioritizes clarity over completeness

⸻

6. Canonical Status

This document is the reference layer for SSA.

All subsequent artifacts — frameworks, tools, curricula, theories — are downstream exports, not replacements.
